	  <h3>Accomplishmets</h3>
	  <p>Some of my life accomplishments include competing in state on the skyline mountain bike team, getting the 360 down on skis, 
	and biking the 200 mile lotaja trail from Logan to jackson hole.
	
	  </ol>
	  <h3>insight</h3>
	  <p> For anyone who wants to accel in any of these three sports, my advice to you is have a mindset that there are no limitations to your 
	progression. You may not get first on your last cross country meet, or can't ride up the entire rattlesnake gulch without uncliping your
        pedals, or are struggling to learn a new freestyle skiing trick. This doesn't mean that you just arent made to acheive those goals. No matter how 
        ambitious they may be, with the right amount of dedication and hardwork, anything is possible when you put your mind to it. Take baby steps, be 
        patient with yourself, and don't give up.
